Hi there,

My name is Sander Rutten.  
Born on April 16th, 1985.  
I was born, raised and still living near Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

### My nickname, and a brief history

My online nickname is *Nakebod*. 
Don't confuse it with something like _naked body_. Although my name is sometimes shorted to just _Naked_. 

So what is the history behind my nickname? I even needed to think about how it all started, since it is just **Nakebod** for years now. 
But that is not how it originally started. _suspense music..._

When I started my internet experience, somewhere around 1995-ish, almost one of the first things you needed was a nickname.
One of the first chat websites I used was provided by [The Music Factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Music_Factory), and it was called TMF Chat.  
Very original :-)  

So young me needed a nickname. Maybe you have heard about [Knäckebröd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kn%C3%A4ckebr%C3%B6d), also known as crispbread in English.
My best guess is that I was eating one of those knäckebröd thingies, and I wanted to use that as joking nickname.

But how did that end up as _Nakebod_? Well.. actually due to the lack of special characters used by the TMF Chat website.
As a 10-year old, it was also very cool to use [1337-speak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet). 

My official nickname? It was _KÑä©ké®ß®öÐ_, but as said due to the lack of some characters it became _KÑäkéßöÐ_. For some unknown reason I changed that to **ÑäkéßöÐ**, which eventually became **Nakebod**.

This name stuck to me ever since.
So when you see this nickname somewhere, 99.99% sure it is me, because... which sane person want's to be called Knäckebröd :-)

Long story short: Hi, I'm _Nakebod_.
