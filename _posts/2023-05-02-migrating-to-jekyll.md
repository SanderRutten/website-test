## Migrating from Wordpress to Jekyll
Today I have started the migration of my Wordpress website to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). I will also experiment with hosting my site with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
Most of the content is already migrated, but there is some manual work left. It could be possible that a few images are missing or layout is a bit weird.

My site isn't very big or interesting in general. So I will probably delete some articles and only keep the most useful or interesting ones.  
I mean, who cares that my site got a SSL certificate back in 2014? Ok, back then it wasn't that common, but still. So... *delete post* aaaand it's gone.
Only a couple of pages left which could be useful for other people.
